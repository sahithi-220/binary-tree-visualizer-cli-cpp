# Binary Tree Console Visualizer with Traversals and Search
This project implements a Binary Tree using C++ and provides a text-based (console) visual representation of the tree structure. It supports tree construction using level-order insertion, visual output rotated 90°, various traversal algorithms, and utility functions like searching, counting nodes, and calculating tree height.

##  Features
- ✅ Build a Binary Tree using **Level-Order Insertion**
- ✅ Visually display the tree structure in the **console**
- ✅ Support for **tree traversals**:
  - Inorder
  - Preorder
  - Postorder
  - Level Order
- ✅ Calculate:
  - Tree Height
  - Total Number of Nodes
  - Number of Leaf Nodes
- ✅ Search for a value in the tree
- ✅ Clean memory by deleting the entire tree

##  Data Structure Used
- **Binary Tree**: Each node has up to two children (left and right)
- **Recursive Traversals**
- **Queue** for Level Order traversal
